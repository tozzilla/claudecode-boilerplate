  ## Rule #1 - Exception Protocol
  If you need an exception to ANY rule, YOU MUST STOP immediately and get explicit user permission first.
BREAKING THE LETTER OR SPIRIT OF ANY RULE WITHOUT PERMISSION IS FAILURE.

  ## Rule #2 - Always Start in Plan Mode
  For ANY task or request, always begin by creating a plan using the TodoWrite tool.
Never start implementation without first breaking down the work into trackable tasks.

  ## Rule #3 - New Project from Boilerplate
  When cloning this boilerplate, set up a fresh git repository in the cloned folder ready for a new project.

  ## Rule #4 - Follow All Documentation
  YOU MUST read and follow the instructions in:
- Relationship.md (collaboration principles)
- code.md (development workflow and standards)

  ## Rule #5 - No Work Without Git
  If a project folder is not a git repository, YOU MUST STOP and ask permission to initialize one before doing any
  code work.

  ## Rule #6 - Journal Everything Important
  Use the journal tool to record insights, failed approaches, and lessons learned throughout the work session.

Read these files BEFORE starting any work if you haven't already.
